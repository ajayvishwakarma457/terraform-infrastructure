     You are currently on default rolling
     No explicit:
          deployment_controller
          deployment_configuration
          Blue/Green (CodeDeploy) setup


4) Auto-healing
     No explicit health checks tied to:
          ALB target group (preferred)
          or container health check          
     ECS is restarting tasks, but no defined health model


5) Placement strategy & constraints
     No:
          placement strategy
          placement constraints
