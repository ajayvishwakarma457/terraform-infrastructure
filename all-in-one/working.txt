terraform destroy -target=module.vpc
terraform apply -target=module.ec2


in "waf and shield"  we have so many things to do?
but what terraform can do list me out that things


1. Desired count
     PARTIALLY DONE
          You set desired_count = 1
          Pending improvement:
          No dynamic control yet (manual only).
          Not connected to auto scaling policies.


2. Deployment strategy (rolling / blue-green)
     PARTIALLY DONE
     Current state:
          Default rolling deployment
          You set:
               deployment_minimum_healthy_percent
               deployment_maximum_percent
     Pending:
          No Blue/Green (CodeDeploy) setup
          No traffic shifting strategy



3. Auto-healing

     PARTIALLY DONE
     What you have:
          Container healthCheck → ✅
          ECS restarts failed tasks → ✅
     Pending (important):
          No ALB health check (you already said ALB not used)
          No service auto scaling based on metrics


4. Placement strategy & constraints
     NOT DONE
     Missing:
          placement_strategy
          placement_constraints
     Even on Fargate, industry setups usually define at least:
          spread across AZs
          capacity provider weighting
