terraform destroy -target=module.vpc
terraform apply -target=module.ec2


in api gateway services we have so manythings to do?
but what terraform can do list me out that things

# command     = ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -f http://localhost:3000/ || exit 1"]
# command     = ["CMD-SHELL", "node -e \"require('http').get('http://localhost:3000', r => process.exit(r.statusCode === 200 ? 0 : 1)).on('error', () => process.exit(1))\""]


3) Deployment strategy (rolling / blue-green)
     You are currently on default rolling
     No explicit:
          deployment_controller
          deployment_configuration
          Blue/Green (CodeDeploy) setup


4) Auto-healing
     No explicit health checks tied to:
          ALB target group (preferred)
          or container health check          
     ECS is restarting tasks, but no defined health model


5) Placement strategy & constraints
     No:
          placement strategy
          placement constraints
