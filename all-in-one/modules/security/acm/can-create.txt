What it is
    AWS service to issue, manage, and auto-renew SSL/TLS certificates.


What it’s used for
    HTTPS for ALB, CloudFront, API Gateway, App Runner.


Key points
    Free for AWS-managed certs.
    Auto-renewal handled by AWS.
    DNS or Email validation.
    Private keys never exposed.


Critical limitations
    ACM certs cannot be downloaded.
    Regional scope:
        CloudFront → us-east-1 only
        ALB / API Gateway / App Runner → same region as resource



Typical flow
    Request cert (domain/subdomain).
    Validate via DNS (recommended).
    Attach cert to ALB/CloudFront.
    HTTPS enabled.


Industry best practice
    Public certs → ACM
    Internal/private certs → ACM Private CA or external CA
