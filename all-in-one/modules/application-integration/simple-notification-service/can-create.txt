Below is exactly what Terraform can manage in AWS SNS (industry-standard scope). No fluff.

    1. SNS Topics

        Terraform can:
            Create standard topics
            Create FIFO topics
            Set display name
            Enable/disable content-based deduplication (FIFO)
            Tag topics
            Encrypt topics using KMS
        Resource
            aws_sns_topic



    2. SNS Subscriptions
        Terraform can create and manage subscriptions for:
            Email / Email-JSON
            SMS
            HTTP / HTTPS
            SQS (this is industry standard)
            Lambda
            Application (mobile push)

        It can define:
            Protocol
            Endpoint
            Raw message delivery
            Filter policies
            Subscription attributes

        Resource
            aws_sns_topic_subscription

    
    3. Message Filtering (Filter Policies)
        Terraform can:
            Attach filter policies to subscriptions
            Filter by message attributes
            Enable fan-out patterns (one topic → multiple consumers)

        Used inside
            aws_sns_topic_subscription


    4. Access Policies (Topic Policies)
        Terraform can:
            Allow who can publish
            Allow cross-account publishing
            Allow AWS services (S3, CloudWatch, EventBridge) to publish
            Restrict actions with conditions

        Resource
            aws_sns_topic_policy

    5. Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)
        Terraform can:
            Configure SQS DLQ for SNS subscriptions

            Handle failed message deliveries
        Used via
            Subscription redrive policy

    6. KMS Encryption
        Terraform can:
            Encrypt SNS topics using KMS CMK
            Rotate keys
            Control who can decrypt messages

        Fields
            kms_master_key_id

    7. Delivery Retry & Delivery Policies
        Terraform can:
            Configure retry behavior
            Configure backoff strategy
            Set delivery throttling
        
        Used in
            Topic attributes / subscription attributes

    8. SMS Preferences (Account-level)
        Terraform can manage:
            SMS spending limit
            Default sender ID
            Default message type (Transactional / Promotional)

        Resource
            aws_sns_sms_preferences

    9. Application Platform (Mobile Push)
        Terraform can:
            Create platform applications (FCM, APNS, etc.)
            Store platform credentials
            Create platform endpoints

        Resources
            aws_sns_platform_application
            aws_sns_platform_endpoint

    10. Event Source Integrations (Indirect)
        Terraform enables SNS to be used by:
            CloudWatch alarms
            EventBridge rules
            S3 event notifications
            Lambda destinations
        (These are configured in other services, but SNS ARN is wired via Terraform)

    
    11. Tags & Naming Standards
        Terraform can:
            Enforce tagging
            Enforce naming conventions across environments
            Reuse SNS modules across dev/stage/prod


    
    Real-world Terraform SNS use cases
        Alerts (CloudWatch → SNS → Email/SMS)
        Fan-out (SNS → SQS → Lambda → multiple services)
        Cross-account event distribution
        Decoupled microservice notifications
