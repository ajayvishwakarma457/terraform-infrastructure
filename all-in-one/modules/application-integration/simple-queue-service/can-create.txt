Amazon SQS — what Terraform can manage (straight list)

    Queue creation & type
        Create Standard queues
        Create FIFO queues
        Set queue name, FIFO suffix, content-based deduplication

    
    Core queue settings
        visibility_timeout_seconds
        message_retention_seconds
        delay_seconds
        receive_wait_time_seconds (long polling)
        maximum_message_size

    Dead-Letter Queues (DLQ)
        Create DLQ queues
        Attach DLQ to main queue
        Configure redrive_policy
        Set maxReceiveCount

    
    Encryption & security   
        Enable SSE-SQS (AWS managed key)
        Enable KMS CMK encryption
        Attach queue policies (IAM)
        Restrict access by AWS account, role, or service

    Access policies
        Allow Lambda / ECS / EC2 / SNS to send or receive
        Cross-account access
        Condition-based policies (source ARN, VPC, IP)

    
    Redrive & replay
        Configure redrive allow policy
        Allow messages to be replayed from DLQ back to source queue

    
    Tags & metadata
        Add tags (env, project, owner, cost-center)

    
    Integration resources (infra side)
        IAM roles for producers/consumers
        Permissions for:
            Lambda → SQS
            SNS → SQS
            EventBridge → SQS


    Terraform-specific capabilities
        Full version-controlled queue config
        Repeatable environments (dev/stage/prod)
        Safe updates (diff before apply)
        Targeted apply/destroy for queues
        Import existing SQS into Terraform state


    What Terraform does NOT do
        Send messages
        Receive messages
        Control consumer logic
        Message ordering logic in app
        Retry logic inside code
        Those are application/runtime responsibilities.
