Terraform can manage almost everything around AWS Lambda. Straight list.

    Lambda function itself
        Create / update / delete Lambda functions
        Runtime (nodejs, python, java, etc.)
        Handler, memory, timeout
        Architecture (x86_64 / arm64)
        Environment variables
        Reserved & provisioned concurrency
        Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)


    Lambda code deployment
        Zip-based deployment
        S3-based code reference
        Versioning
        Aliases (dev / stage / prod)
        Publish new versions safely


    IAM (critical)
        Execution role
        Inline & managed policies
        Permissions boundaries
        Least-privilege IAM setup
        Cross-account invoke permissions



    Triggers / Event sources
        API Gateway (REST / HTTP)
        Application Load Balancer
        EventBridge (cron & events)
        S3 bucket notifications
        SQS queues
        SNS topics
        DynamoDB Streams
        Kinesis streams


    Networking (VPC)
        Attach Lambda to VPC
        Subnets & security groups
        Private access to RDS, Redis, etc.
    

    Logging & Monitoring
        CloudWatch log groups
        Log retention policies
        CloudWatch metrics & alarms
        X-Ray tracing enablement


    Security
        KMS encryption for env vars
        Code signing config
        Resource-based policies
        Permission boundaries
        Secrets via Secrets Manager / SSM


    Scaling & performance
        Reserved concurrency
        Provisioned concurrency
        Alias-based traffic shifting
        Canary / linear deployments


    Layers
        Create Lambda layers
        Version layers
        Attach multiple layers
        Share layers across functions/accounts


    Deployment safety
        Blue/Green via aliases
        Rollbacks
        Immutable deployments
        Environment separation (dev/stage/prod)


    Terraform-specific benefits
        Repeatable infra (no console drift)
        One-click recreate
        State tracking
        Dependency management
        Multi-environment consistency


    What Terraform does NOT do
        Write your Lambda business logic
        Debug runtime code issues
        Replace CI/CD (but integrates with it)


    Bottom line
        Terraform handles infrastructure, permissions, wiring, scaling, security, and lifecycle.
        Your code only handles business logic.
