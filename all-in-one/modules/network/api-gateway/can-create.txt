Terraform can manage these parts of AWS API Gateway (REST / HTTP / WebSocket):

    API & Protocol
        Create API (REST, HTTP, WebSocket)
        API name, description
        Endpoint type (EDGE / REGIONAL / PRIVATE)

    Resources & Routes
        REST: resources (/users, /orders/{id})
        REST: methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        HTTP API: routes (GET /users)
        WebSocket: routes ($connect, $disconnect, custom)


    Integrations (Backend wiring)
        Lambda integration
        HTTP/HTTPS backend
        ALB / NLB (via VPC Link)
        Mock integration
        Integration request/response mapping

    Authorization & Security
        IAM authorization
        Lambda Authorizer
        Cognito User Pool Authorizer
        API keys
        Usage plans (rate limit, quota)
        Resource policies (IP allow/deny, VPC-only access)

    Stages & Deployments
        Deployment versions
        Stages (dev, staging, prod)
        Stage variables
        Auto-deploy (HTTP API)


    Throttling & Limits
        Per-stage throttling
        Per-method throttling
        Burst & rate limits

    Custom Domain & TLS
        Custom domain name
        ACM certificate attachment
        Base path mapping
        Route53 DNS record

    Logging & Monitoring
        CloudWatch log groups
        Access logs
        Execution logs
        X-Ray tracing

    CORS
        CORS configuration
        Preflight OPTIONS setup


    VPC Connectivity
        VPC Link
        Private API Gateway
        Interface VPC Endpoints

    WebSocket–specific
        Route selection expression
        Connection management
        Integration per route

    Outputs & Automation
        API invoke URL
        Stage URL
        Deployment automation via CI/CD

    Bottom line:
        Terraform handles infra, config, security, routing, scaling rules, domains, logs.
        It does not manage your backend logic (Lambda code, app behavior).
