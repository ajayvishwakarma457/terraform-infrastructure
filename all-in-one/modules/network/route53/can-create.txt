Core Route 53 resources Terraform can create/manage


1. Hosted Zones
    Public hosted zones (internet-facing domains)
    Private hosted zones (VPC-internal DNS) (pending)
    Associate / disassociate private zones with VPCs (pending)

Examples:
    example.com public zone
    internal.example.com private zone linked to VPC

================================================================================================================================================================

2. DNS Records

    All common record types:
        A, AAAA
        CNAME
        MX
        TXT
        NS
        SRV
        PTR
        CAA

    Advanced routing supported:
        Simple routing
        Weighted routing
        Latency-based routing
        Geolocation routing
        Geoproximity routing (skipping)
        Failover routing
        Alias records (ALB, NLB, CloudFront, S3, API Gateway, Lightsail) (pending)   

================================================================================================================================================================

3. Health Checks

    HTTP / HTTPS / TCP health checks (https and tcp pending)
    String matching (pending)
    Failure thresholds
    CloudWatch alarm–based health checks (pending)
    Used for:
        Failover DNS  
        Active-passive setups 


================================================================================================================================================================

4. Traffic Policies (not used in the industries)

    Traffic policy documents
    Traffic policy instances
    Used for complex routing logic (less common, but supported)


================================================================================================================================================================

5. Domain Registration (Limited) (do domain registration for manually)
    Terraform can:
        Register domains
        Manage domain settings (auto-renew, transfer lock)
        Manage name servers
    Note: many teams don’t manage domain registration in Terraform; they only manage DNS.


================================================================================================================================================================

6. Query Logging

    Enable Route 53 query logging
    Send DNS query logs to CloudWatch Logs


================================================================================================================================================================

7. Resolver (VPC DNS – important for enterprises) (this section is only for premises level not for the web)

    Inbound resolver endpoints
    Outbound resolver endpoints
    Resolver rules (forwarding rules)
    Rule associations with VPCs

Used for:
    Hybrid DNS (on-prem ↔ AWS)
    Corporate DNS integration


================================================================================================================================================================

8. DNSSEC (pending)
    Enable DNSSEC signing
    Manage KMS keys for DNSSEC
    Key signing key (KSK)

================================================================================================================================================================

In real projects, Terraform is mostly used for
    90% of cases:
    Hosted zones
    A / CNAME / Alias records
    Health checks + failover
    Private DNS for microservices
    Resolver rules for hybrid setups
